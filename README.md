In these files we explore Natural Language Processing and Convolutional Neural Networks.

In the file for NLP, we do sentiment analysis using three different libraries: VADER, TextBlob, and Flair. Using a data set that contains comments with a corresponding label of positive, negative, or neutral, we use the NLP libraries to predict the sentiment of each comment. We then measure the accuracy of every method used.

In the file for the CNNs, we explore and convert the data to a format that is suitable to work with using the library Keras. We then train our CNNs with a percentage of the images to later predict the label of unseen data.
